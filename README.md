# Edit your RestoReady theme locally

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/restoready_theme.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/restoready_theme)

The RestoReady theme gem is a command line tool that lets you make live changes to themes on your RestoReady site.

It will watch your local folders for any changes in your theme (including adding and removing files) and will update your .restoready.com site to the latest changes.

You do not need to make changes to your default theme. You can leverage the theme preview feature of RestoReady
that allows you to view what an unpublished theme looks like on your RestoReady site.
